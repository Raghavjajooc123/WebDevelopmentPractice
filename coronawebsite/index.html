            <div class="homecontent">
                Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans,
                coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses
                include some cases of the common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses),
                while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in
                chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea.
                There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
                Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae,
                order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense
                single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of
                coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.
                They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron
                micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona from which their name derives.

                        Q. What is a Coronavirus?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In
                        humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the
                        common
                        cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                        Acute
                        Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus
                        disease
                        COVID-19.

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. How does COVID-19 spread?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person
                        to
                        person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with
                        COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.
                        Other
                        people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes,
                        nose
                        or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
                        COVID-19
                        who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3
                        feet) away from a person who is sick.
                        WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share
                        updated findings.

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
                        contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
                    </div>

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. Should I worry about COVID-19?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young
                        adults.
                        However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital
                        care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
                        affect them and their loved ones.

                        We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our
                        communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and
                        good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health
                        authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings
                    </div>

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. Should I wear a mask to protect myself?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking
                        after
                        someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not
                        ill or
                        looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage
                        of
                        masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute
                        Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases
                        they
                        cause are quite different.

                        SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of
                        SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

                    <div class="ques">
                        Q. How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?
                    </div>
                    <div class="ans">
                        A. The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have
                        symptoms
                        of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days,
                        most
                        commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.
